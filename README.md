# P03_Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
This is the project for the third module from the Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.

## Project Overview
This [project](Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb) analyzes the results 
of an A/B Test run by an e-commerce website. In this scenario, the company 
created a new webpage trying to increase the number of users who end up paying 
for their product. My goal was to offer insights to the company so they could 
determine if they would implement the new webpage, keep the old one, or run 
the experiment for a longer time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
